If algorithms fit too complex (hypothesis with high degree equation) then it may be on high variance and low bias. In the latter condition, the new entries will not perform well. Well, there is something between both of these conditions, known as a Trade-off or Bias Variance Trade-off. This tradeoff in complexity is why there is a tradeoff between bias and variance.\n",

It is a type of regression that minimizes the coefficient estimates to zero to reduce the capacity (size) of a model. In this context, the reduction of the capacity of a model involves the removal of extra weights."
